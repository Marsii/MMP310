    <h2>Final Pitch</h2>

    <h3>Game Type</h3>

    <p>I think a somewhat simple rpg would be a good idea. Possibly something in the style of an older rpg.
        It wouldn't be super hard to make and seems pretty achievable. </p>
    <p>Alternatively, an interactive fiction/choose your own adventure game may also be a good idea. It could have similar or most of the same elements but with a lot less work needed for visuals and without a need to figure out combat mechanics</p>

    <h3>Narrative, Setting, Characters</h3>

    <p> I think it would be cool for it to take place in space or on another planet. The main character could wake up another planet and be attempting to get home. They'd need to befriend and talk to aliens and convince them to help them. This could be done through offering services or trading items in order to gain the trust or help of others. They'd need to eventually fight someone for their ship or convince them to join their side. They may also need to avoid being killed by aliens who either want to eat humans or just hate humans.</p>

    <h3>User Interactions</h3>

    <p>Either keyboard or mouse. Either would work for the purpose of this project since you would mostly be controlling where you walk to and what you choose while talking or in battle.
    </p>

    <h3>Style</h3>

    <p>Something cartoony but pleasant to look at would likely be a good idea</p>

    <h3>Advantages or Disadvantages</h3>

    <p>I'll get back to this</p>
